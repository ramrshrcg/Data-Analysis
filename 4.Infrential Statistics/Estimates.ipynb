    "### Statistical Estimation: Making Inferences About the Unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, our goal is often to understand a characteristic of a large group, called a **population**. This characteristic, like the true average height of all students in a country, is called a **population parameter (e.g., μ)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it's usually impossible to measure everyone in a population, we take a smaller subset, called a **sample**, and calculate a characteristic for that sample. This is called a **sample statistic (e.g., x̄, the sample mean)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **estimate** is a specific, observed numerical value calculated from sample data that is used to guess the value of an unknown population parameter. There are two main types of estimates we can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Point Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "A point estimate is a **single numerical value** used to provide our \"best guess\" for an unknown population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Definition:** It is one single number that represents our most likely value for the parameter.\n",
    "*   **Key Example:** The most common example,  is using the **sample mean (x̄)** as a point estimate for the **population mean (μ)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Illustration :**\n",
    "*   You want to know the true average score (μ) of all students on a national exam (the population). This is the unknown parameter.\n",
    "*   You take a sample of students and find their average score is **60 (x̄)**.\n",
    "*   This single value, 60, is your **point estimate** for the true average score of *all* students.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Point Estimates:**\n",
    "*   **Sample Mean (x̄)** estimates the **Population Mean (μ)**.\n",
    "*   **Sample Proportion (p̂)** estimates the **Population Proportion (p)**.\n",
    "*   **Sample Standard Deviation (s)** estimates the **Population Standard Deviation (σ)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Major Limitation of Point Estimates:**\n",
    "While a point estimate gives a precise \"best guess,\" it has a very high probability of being wrong. It's extremely unlikely that the sample mean you calculated (60) is *exactly* the same as the true population mean. Furthermore, the point estimate gives us **no information about our uncertainty**. We don't know if the true mean is likely to be very close to 60 or very far away.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Interval Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "An interval estimate addresses the uncertainty of a point estimate by providing a **range of plausible values** that is likely to contain the unknown population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Definition:** Instead of a single number, it is an interval (e.g., \"between 55 and 65\") that is used to estimate the parameter.\n",
    "*   **Key Concept:** The most common type of interval estimate is called a **Confidence Interval**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Illustration :**\n",
    "Instead of just saying our best guess for the true average score is 60, we can construct an interval estimate.\n",
    "*   Our point estimate (sample mean) is 60.\n",
    "*   We calculate a margin of error based on our sample's variability and size.\n",
    "*   We then state that we are \"95% confident that the true population mean (μ) lies somewhere **between 55 and 65**.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This range, `[55, 65]`, is the **interval estimate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is an Interval Estimate More Useful?**\n",
    "An interval estimate is much more informative because it provides two key pieces of information:\n",
    "1.  **A \"Best Guess\" Range:** It gives us a set of plausible values for the population parameter.\n",
    "2.  **A Measure of Confidence:** It tells us how confident we are that the true parameter lies within that range. The width of the interval also indicates the precision of our estimate—a narrow interval suggests a more precise estimate than a wide one.\n",
    "\n",
